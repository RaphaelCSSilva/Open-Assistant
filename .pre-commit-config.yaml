# WARNING!
#
# When making changes to auto-formatters used in pre-commit hooks, you are
# likely to cause merge conflicts with main and/or other pull requests.
# Fixing them might revert other people's work. Expect pain!
# To avoid accidental reversions and keep it easy to review, please make sure
# that changes here are in a pull request by themselves, that it consists of
# two commits:
#
# 1. The changes to this file
# 2. Changes made by running `python3 -m pre_commit run --all-files`.
#
# Then each time your pull request is blocked by a merge conflict, do the
# following steps:
#
#    git reset HEAD^1 && git checkout -f    # discard the change commit
#    git rebase main                        # re-apply other people's changes
#    python3 -m pre_commit run --all-files  # re-run the rules
#    git add .                              # add the newly changed files
#    git commit -m 'apply pre-commit'       # commit it
#    git push -f                            # force push back to your branch
#
# Keep in mind you may have to do this a few times, as changes here may impact
# other pull requests. Try to keep it up-to-date so they can go in when it'll
# cause least disruption.
